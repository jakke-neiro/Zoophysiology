    "Immunity: In biology, immunity is the balanced state of having adequate biological defenses to fight infection, disease, or other unwanted biological invasion, while having adequate tolerance to avoid allergy, and autoimmune diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immune system: The immune system is a system of many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease. To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity.\n",

    "Innate immunity, or nonspecific immunity, is the natural resistances with which a person is born. It provides resistances through several physical, chemical and cellular approaches. Microbes first encounter the epithelial layers, physical barriers that line skin and mucous membranes. Subsequent general defences include secreted chemical signals (cytokines), antimicrobial substances, fever, and phagocytic activity associated with the inflammatory responses.\n",

    "4. Adaptive immunity, Hankittu immuniteetti, Förvärvad immunitet\n",
    "Adaptive immunity is often sub-divided into two major types depending on how the immunity was introduced. 'Naturally acquired immunity' occurs through contact with a disease causing agent, when the contact was not deliberate, whereas 'artificially acquired immunity' develops only through deliberate actions such as vaccination. Both naturally and artificially acquired immunity can be further subdivided depending on whether immunity is induced in the host or passively transferred from an immune host. 'Passive immunity' is acquired through transfer of antibodies or activated T-cells from an immune host, and is short lived—usually lasting only a few months—whereas 'active immunity' is induced in the host itself by antigen and lasts much longer, sometimes lifelong. The diagram below summarizes these divisions of immunity.\n",

Humoral immunity is so named because it involves substances found in the humours, or body fluids.\n",

Historically, the immune system was separated into two branches: humoral immunity, for which the protective function of immunization could be found in the humor (cell-free bodily fluid or serum) and cellular immunity, for which the protective function of immunization was associated with cells.\n",

    "Passive immunity is the transfer of active humoral immunity in the form of ready-made antibodies. Passive immunity can occur naturally, when maternal antibodies are transferred to the fetus through the placenta, and it can also be induced artificially, when high levels of antibodies specific to a pathogen or toxin (obtained from humans, horses, or other animals) are transferred to non-immune persons through blood products that contain antibodies, such as in immunoglobulin therapy or antiserum therapy.[1] Passive immunization is used when there is a high risk of infection and insufficient time for the body to develop its own immune response, or to reduce the symptoms of ongoing or immunosuppressive diseases\n",
    "\n",
    "Active immunization is the induction of immunity after exposure to an antigen. Antibodies are created by the recipient and may be stored permanently.Active immunization can occur naturally when a microbe or other antigen is received by a person who has not yet come into contact with the microbe and has no pre-made antibodies for defense. The immune system will eventually create antibodies for the microbe, but this is a slow process and, if the microbe is deadly, there may not be enough time for the antibodies to begin being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vaccination is the administration of antigenic material (a vaccine) to stimulate an individual's immune system to develop adaptive immunity to a pathogen. Vaccines can prevent or ameliorate morbidity from infection.\n",

    "Vaccination: accination eller vaccinering är en metod att framkalla skydd mot en viss infektionssjukdom genom tillförsel av vaccin (innehållande antigen), det vill säga ett preparat som aktiverar kroppens immunförsvar mot den sjukdomsalstrande faktorn, till exempel bakterier, virus eller parasiter."
