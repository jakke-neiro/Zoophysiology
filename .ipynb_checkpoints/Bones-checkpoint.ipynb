    "Hydrostatic skeleton, Hydrostaattinen tukiranka, Hydrostatiskt skelett: A hydrostatic skeleton or hydroskeleton is a structure found in many ectothermic organisms and soft-bodied animals consisting of a fluid-filled cavity, the coelom, surrounded by muscles. The pressure of the fluid and action of the surrounding circular, longitudinal, and/or helical muscles are used to change an organism's shape and produce movement, such as burrowing or swimming.\n",

    "2. Exoskeleton\n",
    "An exoskeleton (from Greek έξω, éxō \"outer\" and σκελετός, skeletos \"skeleton\"[1]) is the external skeleton that supports and protects an animal's body, in contrast to the internal skeleton (endoskeleton) of, for example, a human. In usage, some of the larger kinds of exoskeletons are known as \"shells\".\n",

    "Cartilage: is a flexible connective tissue in animals, including the joints between bones, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the bronchial tubes and the intervertebral discs. It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is stiffer and less flexible than muscle.\n",

    "Bone tissue: Bone tissue, or osseous tissue, is the major structural and supportive connective tissue of the body. Bone tissue forms the rigid part of the bones that make up the skeleton.\n",
    "\n",
    "Osteoblast: are cells with single nuclei that synthesize bone. However, in the process of bone formation, osteoblasts function in groups of connected cells. Individual cells cannot make bone, and the group of organized osteoblasts together with the bone made by a unit of cells is usually called the osteon.\n",
    "Osteocyte: An osteocyte, a star-shaped cell, is the most commonly found cell in mature bone, and can live as long as the organism itself.\n",
    "Osteoclast: An osteoclast (from the Greek words for \"bone\" (ὀστέον), and \"broken\" (κλαστός)) is a type of bone cell that breaks down bone tissue. This function is critical in the maintenance, repair, and remodelling of bones of the vertebral skeleton.\n",
