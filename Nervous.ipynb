    "Spinal cord, Selkäydin, Ryggmärgen\n",
    "The spinal cord is a long, thin, tubular bundle of nervous tissue and support cells that extends from the medulla oblongata in the brainstem to the lumbar region of the vertebral column. The brain and spinal cord together make up the central nervous system (CNS).\n",
    "Brain, Aivot, Hjärnan\n",
    "The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell.\n",
    "Medulla oblongata, ydinjatke, förlängda märgen: breathing hearth, digestion\n",
    "The medulla oblongata (or medulla) is located in the hindbrain, anterior to the cerebellum. The medulla oblongata is a cone-shaped neuronal mass responsible for multiple autonomic (involuntary) functions ranging from vomiting to sneezing. The medulla contains the cardiac, respiratory, vomiting and vasomotor centers and therefore deals with the autonomic functions of breathing, heart rate and blood pressure.\n",
    "Pons, Aivosilta, Hjärnbryggan: \n",
    "The pons is part of the brainstem, and in humans and other bipeds lies between the midbrain (above) and the medulla oblongata (below) and in front of the cerebellum.The functions of these four cranial nerves (V-VIII) include sensory roles in hearing, equilibrium, and taste, and in facial sensations such as touch and pain, as well as motor roles in eye movement, facial expressions, chewing, swallowing, and the secretion of saliva and tears.\n",
    "Mesencephalon or midbrain, Keskiaivot, Mitthjärnan: visual reflexes\n",
    "The midbrain or mesencephalon (from the Greek mesos, middle, and enkephalos, brain[1]) is a portion of the central nervous system associated with vision, hearing, motor control, sleep/wake, arousal (alertness), and temperature regulation.\n",
    "Diencephalon, Väliaivot, Mellanhjärnan: , thalamus and hypothalamus: sensory information, thermostat, törst\n",
    "The diencephalon is part of the prosencephalon (forebrain), which develops from the foremost primary cerebral vesicle. The prosencephalon differentiates into a caudal diencephalon and rostral telencephalon. The cerebral hemispheres develop from the sides of the telencephalon, each containing a lateral ventricle. The diencephalon consists of structures that are lateral to the third ventricle, and include the thalamus, the hypothalamus, the epithalamus and the subthalamus.\n",

    "Cerebellum, Pikkuaivot, Lillhjärnan: movement, balance, motor skills, liike, tasapaino, \n",
    "The cerebellum (Latin for \"little brain\") is a region of the brain that plays an important role in motor control. It may also be involved in some cognitive functions such as attention and language, and in regulating fear and pleasure responses,[1] but its movement-related functions are the most solidly established. The cerebellum does not initiate movement, but it contributes to coordination, precision, and accurate timing. It receives input from sensory systems of the spinal cord and from other parts of the brain, and integrates these inputs to fine-tune motor activity.[2] Cerebellar damage produces disorders in fine movement, equilibrium, posture, and motor learning.\n",

    "The reticular activating system (RAS), or extrathalamic control modulatory system, is a set of connected nuclei in the brains of vertebrates that is responsible for regulating wakefulness and sleep-wake transitions. As its name implies, its most influential component is the reticular formation.\n",
    "Limbic system, limbinen järjestelmä, limbic system: emotions, gustatory\n",
    "The limbic system (or paleomammalian brain) is a complex set of brain structures located on both sides of the thalamus, right under the cerebrum.[1] It is not a separate system but a collection of structures from the telencephalon, diencephalon, and mesencephalon.[2] It includes the olfactory bulbs, hippocampus, amygdala, anterior thalamic nuclei, fornix, columns of fornix, mammillary body, septum pellucidum, habenular commissure, cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, limbic cortex, and limbic midbrain areas.The limbic system supports a variety of functions including epinephrine flow, emotion, behavior, motivation, long-term memory, and olfaction.[3] Emotional life is largely housed in the limbic system, and it has a great deal to do with the formation of memories.\n",
    "Amygdala, amygdala, amygdala: sexual\n",
    "he amygdalae (singular: amygdala; /əˈmɪɡdələ/; also corpus amygdaloideum; Latin, from Greek ἀμυγδαλή, amygdalē, 'almond', 'tonsil'[1]) are two almond-shaped groups of nuclei located deep and medially within the temporal lobes of the brain in complex vertebrates, including humans.[2] Shown in research to perform a primary role in the processing of memory, decision-making, and emotional reactions, the amygdalae are considered part of the limbic system.\n",

It connects the left and right cerebral hemispheres and facilitates interhemispheric communication. It is the largest white matter structure in the brain, consisting of 200–250 million contralateral axonal projections.Contents\n",
